                <p class="px-1">
                    "I'm a Computer Science and Applied Mathematics student at the University of the Witwatersrand,
                    with a strong foundation in both programming and mathematics. My work focuses on leveraging these 
                    skills to build robust and innovative projects.
                    I’m particularly drawn to Rust 🦀 and web development,
                    and I aim to build as much as possible in Rust — including this very website."</p>
